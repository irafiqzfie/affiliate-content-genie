This repository is a Next.js 15 (App Router) project focused on generating affiliate content (video + post) from Shopee product links.

Key context for AI coding agents
- Framework & runtime: Next.js 15 with the App Router (files under `src/app`). Server routes use Next 15 Route Handlers (exported GET/POST functions returning `NextResponse`).
- Entry points: UI lives in `src/app/page.tsx` and layout in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- API surface: routes under `src/app/api/*` implement server handlers. Important files:
  - `src/app/api/generate/route.ts` â€” calls an external generative API (Gemini) and expects an environment variable `API_KEY`.
  - `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` â€” product analysis route (returns mock analysis in this repo).
  - `src/app/api/saved-items/route.ts` â€” in-memory saved items API used by the client.

What matters when changing code
- Keep server-only secrets on the server (use `.env.local` for `API_KEY`). `src/app/api/*` files run server-side and may read `process.env` directly.
- Client vs server: `src/app/page.tsx` is client-side (`"use client"` at top). Avoid using Node-only APIs in client files. Use fetch to call the server routes.
- Strict output format: the `generate` route uses a strict system instruction and expects returned content in a particular Markdown shape (---VIDEO START--- / ---POST START--- sections). When adjusting parsing logic, preserve headers and numbering.

Developer scripts and common commands
- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack in scripts). Build: `npm run build`. Lint: `npm run lint`.

Project-specific patterns & conventions
- Local mocks: Several API routes return mocked or in-memory data (see `saved-items`, `analyze`). When adding persistence, swap the in-memory arrays for a database and keep the same JSON shapes.
- Content parsing: The client uses emoji-prefixed section headers (e.g., "ðŸŽ¬ Title:") to parse and reconstruct AI output. If you change those headers, update both `page.tsx` parsing/reconstruction helpers and the `COMBINED_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` in `generate/route.ts`.
- Advanced inputs: The front-end sends `advancedInputs` (an object with `goal`, `platform`, etc.) to the generate API â€” preserve keys and types when changing that contract.

Integration & external dependencies
- Generative model: `src/app/api/generate/route.ts` calls Google Generative Language (Gemini) via an API key; network calls are performed server-side. Handle non-2xx responses and surface meaningful errors to the client.
- Environment: add `API_KEY` to `.env.local` for local testing. Do NOT commit secrets.

Testing, debugging, and quick checks
- Manual UI test: run `npm run dev` then open http://localhost:3000 and try:
  - Analyze: paste a Shopee link (the analyze route here validates for 'shopee' in URL).
  - Generate: ensure `API_KEY` is set or the route will throw.
- API inspection: call the routes directly (e.g., POST `/api/generate` with `{ productLink, advancedInputs }`) to observe raw responses.

Examples from the codebase
- Parsing uses a header regex in `page.tsx` to map emoji headers to keys: look for the `keyMap` and `parseContent` / `reconstructContent` helpers.
- Server-side system instruction (strict output) lives in `src/app/api/generate/route.ts` (variable `COMBINED_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`) â€” keep output format stable.

When submitting PRs
- Include a small manual test plan (what UI flows you exercised). If you change API contracts, add/update callers in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- If adding a new server environment variable, document it in the root `README.md` and throw a helpful error during dev if missing (pattern used in `generate/route.ts`).

If anything in this file is unclear or you need more examples (e.g., more API request/response shapes), tell me which area to expand and I'll add it.
